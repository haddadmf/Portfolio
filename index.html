<h3 id="about">About me:</h3>

Hi! My name is Matthew Haddad and I'm a third year 
student at Saddleback College. I am planning on transferring
to UC Irvine in the Fall of 2025 to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence and would love to combine 
that with my love for programming to pursue a career in AI development.
In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends at the beach, playing poker,
working out at the gym, and playing chess.
